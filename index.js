// 1. What is the DOM, and how does it relate to HTML?
// The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing programs to manipulate the document's structure, style, and content. HTML forms the basis of the document structure, which the DOM models as a hierarchical tree of elements.

// 2. How can you access elements in the DOM using JavaScript?
// You can access elements in the DOM using methods such as getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll.

// 3. Explain the differences between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and getElementsByTagName.
// getElementById returns a single element with the specified ID.
// getElementsByClassName returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the specified class name.
// getElementsByTagName returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the specified tag name.

// 4. What is the purpose of the querySelector method, and how does it differ from querySelectorAll?
// querySelector returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
// querySelectorAll returns a static NodeList of all elements that match a specified CSS selector.

// 5. Explain the concept of event bubbling and how it impacts event handling in the DOM.
// Event bubbling is the process where an event starts at the most specific element and then propagates upward to less specific elements. It impacts event handling because events can be intercepted and handled at any level of the DOM hierarchy.

// 6. How do you stop event propagation in the DOM?
// You can stop event propagation by calling the stopPropagation method on the event object within an event handler.

// 7. What is event delegation, and why is it useful in DOM manipulation?
// Event delegation is a technique where a single event handler is used to manage events for multiple elements by taking advantage of event bubbling. It is useful because it reduces the number of event handlers needed and can handle events for dynamically added elements.

// 8. How can you dynamically create HTML elements using JavaScript?
// You can create HTML elements dynamically using the createElement method, set their properties and attributes, and then append them to the DOM using methods like appendChild or insertBefore.

// 9. Explain the differences between the textContent and innerHTML properties.
// textContent sets or retrieves the text content of an element, including its descendants, without parsing it as HTML.
// innerHTML sets or retrieves the HTML content of an element, allowing HTML tags to be interpreted and rendered.

// 10. How can you modify CSS properties of an element in the DOM using JavaScript?
// You can modify CSS properties of an element using the style property, e.g., element.style.color = 'red';.

// 11. Explain the purpose of the setAttribute and getAttribute methods in DOM manipulation.
// setAttribute sets the value of an attribute on an element.
// getAttribute retrieves the value of an attribute from an element.

// 12. What is the difference between appendChild and insertBefore methods for adding elements to the DOM?
// appendChild adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node.
// insertBefore inserts a node before a reference node as a child of a specified parent node.

// 13. How do you remove elements from the DOM using JavaScript?
// You can remove elements from the DOM using the removeChild method on the parent node or the remove method on the element itself.

// 14. What is the purpose of the parentNode property in DOM manipulation?
// parentNode returns the parent node of a specified node in the DOM tree, allowing you to traverse upwards.

// 15. Explain how to clone an element in the DOM using JavaScript.
// You can clone an element using the cloneNode method. Passing true as an argument clones the element and its descendants, while false clones only the element itself.

// 16. How do you check if an element exists in the DOM using JavaScript?
// You can check if an element exists in the DOM using methods like querySelector or getElementById and checking if the result is not null.

// 17. What is the purpose of the classList property, and how can you use it to manipulate classes?
// classList is a property that returns a live DOMTokenList of the class attributes of an element. You can use methods like add, remove, and toggle to manipulate classes.

// 18. How do you add and remove classes from an element in the DOM?
// You can add classes using the classList.add method and remove classes using the classList.remove method.

// 19. Explain the differences between classList.add, classList.remove, and classList.toggle.
// classList.add adds one or more class names to an element.
// classList.remove removes one or more class names from an element.
// classList.toggle toggles a class name on or off, depending on its presence.

// 20. How can you traverse the DOM tree using JavaScript?
// You can traverse the DOM tree using properties like parentNode, childNodes, firstChild, lastChild, previousSibling, and nextSibling.

// 21. What are data attributes (data-*), and how can you use them in DOM manipulation?
// Data attributes are custom attributes that start with data- and allow you to store extra information on HTML elements. You can access them using the dataset property.

// 22. Explain the purpose of the style property in DOM manipulation.
// The style property allows you to get or set inline CSS styles on an element.

// 23. How can you retrieve the dimensions (width and height) of an element in the DOM?
// You can retrieve the dimensions of an element using properties like offsetWidth, offsetHeight, clientWidth, and clientHeight.

// 24. What is the purpose of the offset properties (offsetWidth, offsetHeight, offsetLeft, offsetTop) in DOM manipulation?
// The offset properties provide the size and position of an element relative to its offsetParent, including borders and padding.

// 25. How do you handle form manipulation in the DOM using JavaScript?
// You can handle form manipulation by accessing form elements through their names or ids, adding event listeners to handle input events, and using properties like value to get or set input values.

// 26. Explain the differences between innerText, textContent, and innerHTML.
// innerText returns the visible text content of an element, taking CSS styling into account.
// textContent returns the text content of an element and all its descendants without styling.
// innerHTML returns or sets the HTML content of an element.

// 27. How do you detect if an element is hidden or visible in the DOM?
// You can detect if an element is hidden or visible using the offsetWidth and offsetHeight properties, or by checking the display or visibility CSS properties.

// 28. What are the differences between the client and offset properties in DOM manipulation?
// Client properties (clientWidth, clientHeight) include the padding but not the border, scrollbar, or margin. Offset properties (offsetWidth, offsetHeight) include padding, border, and scrollbar, but not the margin.

// 29. How can you handle scroll events in the DOM using JavaScript?
// You can handle scroll events by adding an event listener for the 'scroll' event on the window or a specific element.

// 30. Explain the differences between createDocumentFragment and createElement in DOM manipulation.
// createDocumentFragment creates a minimal document object that can hold and manage nodes temporarily. It is not part of the main DOM tree and is useful for performance optimization when inserting multiple elements.
// createElement creates a single element node that is part of the main DOM tree.
